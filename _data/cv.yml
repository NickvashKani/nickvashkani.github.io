    - title: Research Assistant Professor
      institution: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 
      year: 2019 - Present
      description: Currently an assistant research professor in the electrical and computer engineering department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research is focused on specialized algorithms for the retrieval and manipulation of mathematical expressions. I also teach a junior-level undergraduate algorithms course in the department. 

    - title: Senior Software Engineer
      institution: Reservoir Labs
      year: 2018-2019
      description: The company was contracted to develop a LLVM-based C-compiler for a single-instruction, multiple-data (SIMD) processor. Furthermore, I have and continue to develop an operating environment (OE). Similar to OpenCL or CUDA, the operating environment handles kernel- scheduling/execution/synchronization and device memory allocation.

      items:
        - Design and evaluation of spin-based logical devices - The goal of this research was to theoretically model and analyze various spin-dependent effects, including spin-transfer torque, dipolar-coupling, and thermally induced stochasticity, in ferromagnetic thin films. 
        - Physical Design of Network-on-Chip Architectures - We investigated the physical cost associated with NoC interconnection fabric and developed design solutions to mitigate the overhead and achieve the best-case performance at advanced CMOS technology nodes.

    - title: IC Design Intern 
      institution: Broadcom Corporation
      year: 2013
      description: Developed script that automatically ran necessary programs to layout and formally verify chip designs. Performed power-threaded analysis on compiled designs and verified operation of scripted design.
