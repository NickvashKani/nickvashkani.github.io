I have received the [2023 Engineering Council Outstanding Advisors](https://grainger.illinois.edu/about/college-awards) award. I am so grateful to all of you for your many nominations. Iâ€™ve been truly blessed to be surrounded for so many smart and hard-working individuals and hope that we can all keep working hard and keep winning/publishing even more.
