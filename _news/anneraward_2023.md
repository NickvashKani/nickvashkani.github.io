I am honored to receive the [George Anner Excellence in Undergrad Teaching Award](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/teaching). This award was determine by a faculty panel using multiple factors, but I was only eligible because my amazing students and advisees nominated me. I owe you guys big.
